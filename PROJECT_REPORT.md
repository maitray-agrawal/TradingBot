# PrimeTrade AI

## Project Overview
PrimeTrade AI is a Sentiment-Driven Crypto Trading Analytics & Binance Futures Testnet Trading Bot. The system is designed to read and clean raw historical trading records and Bitcoin Fear & Greed index data, perform statistical significance testing, execute engineered trading strategies, generate visual analytics reports, and run a testnet automated trading bot via an interactive dashboard or a command-line interface.

---

## Project Objectives
- **Data Integrity**: Automatically detect, clean, and standardize diverse historical trading and sentiment datasets without requiring manual column mapping.
- **Statistical Rigor**: Apply classical statistical tests (correlation, t-tests, ANOVA) to establish whether Bitcoin Fear & Greed sentiment correlates with trader win rates, trade frequency, and holding behavior.
- **Actionable Logic**: Build a strategy engine that maps Fear/Greed regimes and market volatility metrics to trade action recommendations.
- **Automated Trading**: Develop a secure, validation-locked trading client that interacts with the Binance Futures Testnet, supporting Market, Limit, and Stop-Limit orders.
- **Premium User Experience**: Provide a modern, responsive, and responsive Streamlit dashboard alongside a robust CLI.

---

## Business Problem
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and heavily influenced by retail and institutional sentiment. However, traders often lack the tools to verify if their performance is correlated with sentiment indicators, such as the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. Moreover, testing and executing sentiment-driven strategies on futures contracts requires robust risk validators, automated execution, and clean analytics—features that are rarely unified in a single, lightweight open-source system.

---

## Solution Overview
PrimeTrade AI bridges the gap between trader behavior and market sentiment. It ingests historical trades and daily sentiment scores, aligns them chronologically using nearest-timestamp merging, runs statistical analyses, and generates HTML/PDF reports. These insights feed directly into a Rule-Based Strategy Recommendation Engine, which can be executed in real-time on the Binance Futures Testnet using a modular, validation-wrapped trading bot controlled through a Streamlit UI.

---

## Project Scope
- **In-Scope**:
  - Auto-detection of CSV, XLSX, JSON, and Parquet data formats in the data directory.
  - Data normalizer that resolves column name variations and cleans missing/incorrect values.
  - Feature engineering generating time features, rolling volume, realized PnL, and cumulative returns.
  - Nearest-date merging between daily sentiment indices and sub-second trader executions.
  - Statistical testing suites including Pearson, Spearman, Mann-Whitney U, Independent T-Test, and ANOVA.
  - Visualizations saved as publication-quality static and interactive Plotly figures.
  - Automated report compilation (Markdown, HTML, PDF).
  - Binance Futures Testnet bot supporting BUY/SELL for MARKET, LIMIT, and STOP-LIMIT orders with configurable risk controls.
  - Streamlit dashboard for real-time overview, uploads, charting, strategy config, order forms, and logs.
- **Out-of-Scope**:
  - Real-money Binance Production mainnet trading (locked to Testnet).
  - Multi-user authentication and database persistence (uses file system storage).
  - High-frequency tick-by-tick backtesting engine.

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline flows in sequential, isolated steps:

```
[Raw Files] ➔ [Format Detector] ➔ [Header Normalizer] ➔ [Data Cleaner] 
            ➔ [Feature Generator] ➔ [Chronological Merger] ➔ [Merged CSV]
```

### Dataset Information

#### Dataset 1: Historical Trader Data
Includes transaction logs from user trade history.
- **Expected Columns**: Account ID, Symbol, Coin/Asset, Execution Price, Trade Size, Side (Buy/Sell), Timestamp, Closed PnL, Fees, Tx Hash.
- **Format Flexibility**: Can be loaded from Excel (`.xlsx`), Comma-Separated (`.csv`), JSON (`.json`), or Parquet (`.parquet`).

#### Dataset 2: Fear & Greed Index Data
Daily index representing general crypto market sentiment.
- **Expected Columns**: Date, Classification, Timestamp, Value.
- **Format Flexibility**: Can be loaded from CSV, JSON, or Parquet.

### Expected Dataset Formats
- **CSV**: standard comma-delimited text.
- **Excel**: standard workbook formatting (processes the first sheet).
- **JSON**: array of objects or key-value structures.
- **Parquet**: column-oriented binary data, ensuring efficient loading.

### Dataset Detection Logic
The dataset format detector parses the first row of any candidate file in `data/`, standardizes the characters (stripping casing, spaces, and underscores), and measures the intersection count against a target schema pattern:
- **Fear & Greed Targets**: `{"classification", "value", "date", "timestamp"}`
- **Trader History Targets**: `{"account", "coin", "symbol", "price", "executionprice", "closedpnl", "side", "size", "timestamp"}`
The file is classified based on the highest intersection percentage (requiring a minimum 25% overlap).

### Column Standardization Rules
To handle inconsistencies across different exchange exports:
- `Execution Price`, `price`, `exec_price`, `executionprice` ➔ `execution_price`
- `ClosedPnL`, `closedPnL`, `profit`, `PnL`, `profit_loss` ➔ `closed_pnl`
- `Coin`, `Symbol`, `Asset` ➔ `symbol`
- `Timestamp`, `Date`, `Time`, `datetime` ➔ `timestamp`
- `Size`, `Amount`, `Qty`, `quantity` ➔ `size`
- `Side`, `Direction` ➔ `side`

### Data Cleaning Strategy
1. **Deduplication**: Remove identical records.
2. **Missing Values**: Drop rows where critical variables (timestamp, symbol, side, size) are missing.
3. **Format Alignment**: Standardize all symbols to uppercase. Convert trade sides to a binary `BUY`/`SELL` indicator.
4. **Timestamp Standardization**: Dynamically handle string ISO formats, unix seconds, and unix milliseconds, standardizing all to microseconds-normalized `datetime64[ns]` timezone-naive timestamps.
5. **Anomaly Filtering**: Remove transactions where `execution_price` or `size` is negative or zero.

### Feature Engineering Plan
- **Time Partitions**: Derive `hour` (0-23), `day` (1-31), `weekday` (0-6), `month` (1-12), and `week` (1-53).
- **Trade Direction**: Convert `side` to numerical directions: `BUY` ➔ `1`, `SELL` ➔ `-1`.
- **Trade Value**: Compute total notional size as `size` * `execution_price`.
- **Profitability Indicators**: Identify positive returns (`is_profit`) and calculate `profit_percentage` as `(closed_pnl / trade_value) * 100`.
- **Running Aggregates**: Track `cumulative_pnl` as a running sum. Compute `rolling_pnl` and `rolling_volume` over a moving window of trades.
- **Realized Daily PnL**: Map the daily sum of all closed PnL back to all trades occurring on that date.

---

## Analytics Pipeline
The analytics pipeline aggregates the merged dataset to compile comprehensive metrics:
- **Trader Analysis**: Calculate total Win Rate, Loss Rate, Average Profit/Loss, profit-to-loss ratio, and Trade Frequency.
- **Symbol Analysis**: Evaluate which assets perform best under specific market conditions.
- **Holding Behavior**: Analyze how long positions are held relative to profitability (if entry/exit timestamps are present).
- **Risk Analysis**: Map drawdown distributions, standard deviations of returns, and value-at-risk.
- **Fear vs Greed Analysis**: Group trading outcomes by sentiment regimes (Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed).

---

## Statistical Analysis Pipeline
Provides statistical validation for behavioral hypotheses:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Spearman and Pearson rank correlations between Fear & Greed values and realized PnLs.
- **Parametric Tests**: Independent T-Tests to compare average profit sizes between Greed and Fear regimes.
- **Non-Parametric Tests**: Mann-Whitney U tests to assess performance distributions when the normality assumption is violated.
- **ANOVA**: One-way Analysis of Variance to determine if average trade sizes or PnL outcomes differ significantly across all five sentiment categories.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Compute 95% confidence bounds around win rates and average profits.

---

## Visualization Pipeline
Generates publication-quality figures:
- **Cumulative PnL**: Line charts tracking account trajectory over time.
- **Win/Loss Metrics**: Visual distributions of profitable vs unprofitable trades.
- **PnL Distribution**: Histograms fitted with kernel density estimations (KDE).
- **Performance by Sentiment Category**: Box and Violin plots illustrating return distributions across Fear/Greed classifications.
- **Asset breakdown**: Treemaps outlining trade value distribution and profitability per coin.
- **Correlation Matrix**: A colored heatmap showcasing relationships between sentiment, size, price, and outcomes.

---

## Strategy Recommendation Engine
Recommends actions based on statistical insights and current sentiment scores:
- **Extreme Fear Regime**: Evaluates historical performance during panics; suggests buying high-win-rate assets or reducing size.
- **Extreme Greed Regime**: Suggests taking profits or tightening Stop-Loss percentages.
- **High Volatility Condition**: Recommends using Limit orders rather than Market orders to avoid slippage.
- **Configuration**: System thresholds (e.g. Extreme Greed limit) are defined in `.env` or configuration JSON files.

---

## Trading Bot Architecture
A Binance Futures Testnet trading bot built on top of `python-binance`:
- **Client layer**: Wrapper handling authentication, REST endpoints, and connection retries.
- **Risk Validator**: Checks account leverage, remaining margin, and maximum position size before routing orders.
- **Order Managers**: Translates internal recommendations into API calls for BUY/SELL actions using MARKET, LIMIT, and STOP-LIMIT orders.
- **Retry and Timeout**: Uses exponential backoff to handle connection timeouts and API rate limit thresholds.
- **Graceful Failure**: Ensures that if an order fails or a connection is lost, open positions are safely logged and no orphaned orders remain active.

---

## Dashboard Architecture
A Streamlit multi-page dashboard:
1. **Overview**: Executive summaries of account status, active balances, and recent performance.
2. **Upload Dataset**: File-uploader interface storing raw datasets inside `/data` for automated ingestion.
3. **Analytics & Stats**: Interactive tables of performance metrics and outputs from statistical significance testing.
4. **Interactive Charts**: Rendered Plotly charts (PnL lines, violin plots, treemaps) with download triggers.
5. **Strategy & Bot Control**: Configures trading thresholds, sets order details, and initiates/stops the automated bot.
6. **Real-time Logs**: Visual terminals displaying live updates from `analytics.log` and `bot.log`.

---

## Configuration Management
Configurations are stored in `.env` and loaded using Pydantic schemas in `config/settings.py`:
- Credentials: API keys, secrets, and testnet selection variables.
- Operational Paths: Configures data, output, and logging directory paths.
- Parameters: Default trading leverage, default risk sizes, stop-loss ratios, and sentiment thresholds.

---

## Logging Architecture
Structured log output is managed via the standard logging module, routed to files in the `trading_bot/logs/` folder:
- **`analytics.log`**: Traces dataset detection, cleaning logs, engineered features, and report operations.
- **`bot.log`**: Records order states, risk validation checks, client connection events, and executions.
- **`errors.log`**: Standardizes error-level logs from all packages, creating a central location for troubleshooting.

---

## Exception Handling Strategy
- **Ingestion Failures**: Logs file-read errors and continues scanning other candidates.
- **API Exceptions**: Catches `BinanceAPIException` and handles rate-limit headers (HTTP 429) or invalid credentials.
- **Risk Violations**: Raises custom exceptions (e.g., `InsufficientMarginError`) to halt execution before order transmission.
- **Execution Safeguard**: Uses a central `try-except-finally` wrapper in the bot run loop to cancel pending orders if unhandled exceptions occur.

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Verifies data normalization, feature engineering, and merging logic on static mock datasets using `pytest`.
- **Mock Trading Client**: Uses pytest mock objects to simulate Binance Testnet responses without sending network requests.
- **Integration Tests**: Executes end-to-end data parsing runs to verify pipeline consistency.

---

## Deployment Strategy
- **Local Deployment**: Runs locally using a Python virtual environment and Streamlit.
- **Containerization**: Configures a `Dockerfile` to package python dependencies and run the dashboard.
- **Secrets Management**: Employs environment files (`.env`) to separate credentials from version control.

---

## Coding Standards
- **Typing**: Enforces Python static type hints across all function parameters and return structures.
- **Documentation**: Requires clear docstrings for all classes, methods, and modules.
- **Design Pattern**: Adheres to SOLID principles, keeping data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and trading execution in isolated packages.

---

## Security Considerations
- **Credentials Protection**: `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.
- **Bot Safety**: Position sizing is constrained by hardcoded maximum allocation limits.
- **Input Validation**: Uploaded datasets are verified for column coverage and size before processing.

---

## Scalability Considerations
- **Streaming Pipeline**: Reads datasets in chunks or uses lightweight metadata queries to manage large files.
- **Vectorized Data Operations**: Relies on vectorized Pandas/NumPy logic rather than manual row iteration.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Prepares bot websocket connections to support concurrent asset tracking in the future.

---

## Future Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Architecture Initialization (Current).
- **Phase 2**: Dataset Ingestion.
- **Phase 3**: Preprocessing & Cleaning.
- **Phase 4**: Feature Engineering.
- **Phase 5**: Behavior & Profitability Analytics.
- **Phase 6**: Statistical Analysis Suite.
- **Phase 7**: Charting & Visualization.
- **Phase 8**: Report Compilers (HTML/PDF/Markdown).
- **Phase 9**: Strategy Recommendation Engine.
- **Phase 10**: Binance Futures Testnet Trading Bot.
- **Phase 11**: Streamlit Dashboard.
- **Phase 12**: Unit and Integration Testing.
- **Phase 13**: Deployment Setup.
- **Phase 14**: System Documentation.

---

## Known Constraints
- **Sentiment Resolution**: The Fear & Greed Index is updated once daily, meaning sub-day trades will match to the same daily sentiment value.
- **API Dependencies**: Binance Futures Testnet availability is subject to exchange uptime and credentials validation.
- **System Memory**: Streamlit displays large dataframes in memory, which may cause performance drops if trader files contain millions of entries.
